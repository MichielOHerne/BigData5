Software Applications are rapidly being developed to meet the demands of its end-users with new and performant features. This trend is particularly apparent in app stores for iOS or Android devices where apps are regularly being updated with improvements and performance fixes.

The task of this project is to investigate to what degree we can run outdated versions of a Software Project today. You will be investigating software projects on Github where projects are versioned and old software releases are available. You will also develop a set of metrics and use sources such as TravisCI to find out indicators whether an old version of a project will be able to run. To this end, you will be able to answer something in these lines: “For a Github project A, there are 16 versions, 6 versions are likely to run today while the 10 other versions are not”
